TODO:
    Anti-affinities (some VMs cannot be placed on the same PM)
    Initialize "best cost so far" with a heuristic
    Generator should create more realistic problems

Advanced TODO:
    Give some allocation even when the problem is unsolvable (+different priorities for VMs)
    Bound: determine a minimal cost for the unallocated VMs (lower bound for the complete allocation)
