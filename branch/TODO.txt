    x PM order alterable for a VM (according to resources free or initial allocation)
    x Logging: how does "best cost so far" change during the algorithm
    x Terminate when running for x seconds
    x Bound also when the cost is near the "best cost so far"

TODO:
    Other sorting methods for PMs (max or sum of resources)
    Run profiler
    Iterative cost computation
    Initialize "best cost so far" with a heuristic

Advanced TODO:
    Bound: determine a minimal cost for the unallocated VMs (lower bound for the complete allocation)
